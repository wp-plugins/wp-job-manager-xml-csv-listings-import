Easily import job listings from any XML or CSV file to the WP Job Manager plugin with the WP Job Manager Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The WP Job Manager Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your job listings to the WP Job Manager plugin in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a job from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the WP Job Manager fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a job opening in WP Job Manager.

We have several other add-ons available, each specific to a different theme or plugin. This is a walkthrough of the Realia Add-On, which is very similar to the WP Job Manager Add-On.
